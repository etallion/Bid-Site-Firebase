# Bid-Site-Firebase-Realtime
Example of Firebase Realtime DB

This is just real quick example of the setting up a realtime database on Firebase. I will email you my creditionals/database info and you will just need to included in the .js file where indicated in the comments. For this example we can all use this one to see how it work, but I am sure you will want to sign up and try making your own.

TRY THIS

Open this in two browsers so you can see them both. Start submitting bids for either one and see what happens.

Next, we can add a "Viewers watching" count display that shows the open connections on this page (socket).
